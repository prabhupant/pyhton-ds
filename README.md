# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains data structures and algorithms concepts and questions in Python.

## :dart: Objective

The open source community has helped me a lot during my interview preparations and studies while I was in my undergrad. I always wanted to give something back to the community. In my endeavour to contribute something back, I will be uploading data structures and algorithms questions in Python in this repo. Feel free to contribute and get in touch! :smiley:

## :file_folder: Structure of the repository

As of now, the repository contains a file called **[`Bookmarks`](https://github.com/prabhupant/python-ds/blob/master/bookmarks/.)** and 2 main directories: **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**.

### Data Structures

Contains all data structure questions categorised into sub-directories like stack, queue, etc according to their type.

1. Array
2. Dictionary
3. Binary Search Tree
4. Linked List
5. Stack
6. Graphs
7. Circular Linked List

### Algorithms

This directory contains various types of algorithm questions like Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Greedy, etc. The current structure of this directory is like -

1. Dynamic Programming
2. Math
3. Sorting
4. Greedy
5. Misc

### Bookmarks

## :clipboard: Things need to be done

As you can see, the repo is still in its infancy. Here are some key things in the to-do.

1. Queue questions
2. Algorithms
    2.1. Dynamic Programming
    2.2. Greedy
3. More questions in data structures, especially for graph, circular linked list, tries, heaps and hash.
